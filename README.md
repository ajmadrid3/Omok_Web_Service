# Omok_Web_Service
This project is for CS 3360 Design and Implementation of Programming Languages.  The project is to create a lightweight PHP web service 
to play the game Omok.  The objective of the game is to get 5 stones in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.  This 
web service will work with the provided Java client, save the current game for future playing, and provide the ability to play against 
two different move strategies.
